A rewrite of stacklisp in C for portability

I got bored while trying to add GC to stacklisp. I wasn't going to enjoy adding anything new to the language if it wasn't going to be practical. It occurred to me that if I had created the programming language with GC in mind from the start, I could've done it. And, I've been thinking lately that it would be nice to rewrite the project in C. Writing it in x64 assembly was a fun challenge, and it works better than I could have ever imagined (considering I had very little knowledge of assembly before and have still never taken any CS in university). But, it's inconvenient to work with assembly. That, and putting stuff on the stack the way I did can be really efficient (it was) but it was obviously going to be hard to debug (and it was). Inconvenience and hardship is usually a part of the fun for me, but this time I want something practical. I want to make a real language. I want to make something that isn't just a toy. It's hard to do that when the project only works on one platform and leaks memory like a busted fire hydrant.
